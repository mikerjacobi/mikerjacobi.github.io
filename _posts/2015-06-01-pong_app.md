Pong App is an Android app I wrote that tracks Ping Pong scores. 

Each time a point is scored, you click the corresponding player to record it. For each game, this app records the final score, the time that each point was scored, the order that each point was scored, and the winner of the game.

The app is a client that communicates with a Python server to record the timestamps and scorer of every point. This data is stored in MongoDB. There is a visualization website that reads pong data to produce various graphs - One that shows an individual game and how the score developed, another that shows the previous few games final scores between two players, and finally, a graph that shows the wins between two players over time.

Here's a screenshot of the Android client.
